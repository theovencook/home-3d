 * with `opening_links_saved`). Only openings without a contact of their own are filled; a contact set by hand, "none"
 * and a window with a handle sensor (which never got a plain contact) stay as they are. Returns how many links were
 * written; 0 and no mark at all when Home Assistant has not told its entities yet (it runs again on the next load).
 * Idempotent: a marked plan is not touched, and a second run on an unmarked one finds nothing left to fill.
