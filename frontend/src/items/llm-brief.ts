// The brief for an LLM (#14): a short, self-contained description of the item format that the item editor copies,

// written from the lists and limits in item-format.ts (a test holds them equal to the backend's schema in packs.py)
// and the library's sections and rooms (vocabulary.ts), so it says what the import checks. Pure text, no DOM.

  return `You design one item (a piece of furniture or another thing in a home) for Home 3D, a 3D floor plan for Home Assistant. Ask me what the item is if I have not said, then answer with the item.

ANSWER
Answer with ONE JSON object and nothing else: no explanation, no comments, no trailing commas. I paste it into Home 3D's item editor (${ITEMS_EN.ie_paste} → ${ITEMS_EN.ie_paste_import}), or save it as <id>.json for "${ITEMS_EN.ie_import}"; the editor checks it against the rules below, and it must import as it is.

THE ITEM
- "id" (required): 1 to 40 characters: lower-case letters, digits, "_", "." and "-", starting with a letter or a digit. Make it from the name ("Oak wall shelf" → "oak_wall_shelf").
- "name" (required): the name by language code, at least English: {"en": "Oak wall shelf"}. 1 to ${f.maxNameLength} characters, a readable name in UK English (Wardrobe, Hob, Worktop), not a product name.
- "size" (required): the real size in metres as [width, depth, height], each ${range(f.metres)}. Width runs left to right as you face the item's front, depth from back to front.
- "parts" (required): 1 to ${f.maxParts} parts (see PARTS). 5 to 30 is usually right; keep it low-poly.
- "group": what it is, its section in the library: ${list(kinds)}.
- "room": up to ${f.maxRooms} rooms it is made for: ${list(rooms)}. Leave it out for any room.
- "tags": up to ${f.maxTags} more search words, 1 to ${f.maxTagLength} characters each.
- "mount": where it sits: ${list(f.mounts)}. "floor" is the default; "surface" stands on the item below it (a lamp on a table); "wall" hangs on a wall with its bottom "wall_y" metres above the floor (${range(f.wallY)}, default 1); "ceiling" hangs from the ceiling.
- "surface": true when its top carries other items (tables, worktops, sideboards).
- "electric": true when it can be linked to a switch and a power sensor (appliances, lamps, TVs).
- "light": for a lamp, how its light spreads: ${list(f.lights)}.
- "ikea": the IKEA product name, only if it is one ("KALLAX").
No other fields are allowed, in the item or in a part. Leave out any optional field you do not need.

PARTS
Every measure of a part is a fraction of the item's size, so the item can be resized in the plan:
- "x", "z": the part's centre across and in depth, ${range(f.centre)}. x 0.5 is the right edge, z 0.5 is the FRONT edge, z -0.5 the back (against the wall).
- "w", "d", "h": the part's width, depth and height, ${range(f.extent)} (1 is the item's whole width, depth or height).
- "y": the part's bottom, ${range(f.level)} of the item's height (0 is the floor). Keep y + h at most 1 and every part inside the item's box: x ± w/2 and z ± d/2 within -0.5 to 0.5.
- "shape": one of:
${f.shapes.map((s) => `  - "${s}": ${SHAPES[s]}`).join("\n")}
- "color": a colour role (preferred: the plan's theme colours it) or "#rrggbb" for a fixed colour. Roles:
${f.colourRoles.map((r) => `  - "${r}": ${ROLES[r]}`).join("\n")}
- "top": another colour (role or "#rrggbb") for the part's top face.
- "fix": the measures the part KEEPS when the item is resized: "w", "d", "h" or several ("wd", "wdh"). Legs keep "wd", table tops, shelves and plinths keep "h", handles keep "wdh". Parts without fix (the carcass, a seat) stretch between them.
- "rot": a turn of the part around its own upright axis in degrees (${range(f.rot)}), for diagonal struts or spiral steps.
- "glow": true for the part of a lamp that lights up (shade, bulb).
- "screen": true for a TV or monitor screen; its front (+z) shows the picture.
- "edges": true, "glow" or "faint" draws outlines; rarely needed.

GOOD ITEMS
- Parts touch or overlap; nothing floats. Legs stand on y 0, a top sits on its legs.
- Use the real proportions of the thing; fractions are of the item's own size, so a 2 cm top on a 75 cm table is h 0.027.
- Put the front (doors, drawers, the screen, the seat) towards +z.
