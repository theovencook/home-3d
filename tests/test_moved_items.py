"""Bundled items can move between packs without breaking plans (#110).

An item's type names its pack ("pack:<pack>:<item>"), so a move changes the id every placed copy, recipe copy, pin and
rollback entry refers to. The moved-items table (custom_components/home_3d/moved_items.json) maps old types to new
ones; plans migrate wherever they come in, and old ids still resolve.

The fixture: the pack `test.old` was split and retired. Its cube chair moved to `test.new` under the same id, its lamp
moved and was renamed `reading_lamp`. `test.new` is installed; `test.old` is not.
