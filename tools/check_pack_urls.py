"""Check that packs install by URL from real GitHub, with the code Home Assistant uses (needs the network).

    python tools/check_pack_urls.py [REPO_URL] [PACK_ID ...]

Defaults to https://github.com/theovencook/home-3d-packs and the packs theovencook.living and theovencook.ikea-uk.
For each pack it fetches the folder URL (<repo>/tree/main/<pack id>) with custom_components/home_3d/pack_github.py,
checks the files with the pack schema, and runs the update check against an older commit. It also checks that the
repository URL alone is refused with the folder URLs. Exits with an error when anything fails. Run it where
Home Assistant's packages are installed (the project's test virtualenv).
