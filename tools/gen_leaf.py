"""Writes the Nissan Leaf and its colourways (theovencook.outdoor/vehicle/nissan_leaf*.json), #242, #252, #345.

    python tools/gen_leaf.py

The second-generation Leaf (ZE1, 2018 on) at 4490 x 1790 x 1540 mm, wheelbase 2700 mm: a rounded hatchback with a short
bonnet sloping down to the nose, a steeply raked windscreen, a high rear with a kick in the window line, black pillars
under a body-coloured roof (the "floating roof") ending in a spoiler, slim LED headlights swept back round the
corners to a blue-tinted V-motion grille, and at the back dark tailgate glass reaching down between boomerang tail
lights. The body, glasshouse and roof are curved shells (#252) traced from photos of the car; the lamps are strips of
turned lofts lying on the curved corners (#345); the rest are simple shapes. Modelled by us; no logos, no maker
images, no 3D files. The other cars come from tools/gen_vehicles.py.

The body, the body-coloured roof and the mirrors are in the colour role "paint" (#404) with the colourway's colour as
the item's own colour for it (`"colors": {"paint": …}`), so the item panel's car colours repaint every Leaf; a two-tone
roof keeps its own fixed colour. Windows are in the palette role "glass" and the lamps in the colours the viewer lights for a linked car (headlights
#e8f4ff, tail lights #ff3b4f): the car feature's lights and cabin glow show on it. Every part above the waist sits inside the
glasshouse or just proud of it, so nothing stands out of the body.
