"""The plan's copies of the recipes of its pack items (#2).

A placed pack item is stored with its type "pack:<pack id>:<item id>"; the plan keeps one copy of that item's recipe
under `building["recipes"][type]`, one per type however often it is placed. The copy is what the views draw, so
removing a pack or installing a newer release of it never changes a placed item; an update replaces the copy on
purpose (#26).

A copy is {"pack", "item", "release", "hash", "recipe"} and, for a pack installed from GitHub, the "commit" its files
came from. `hash` is recipe_hash() of the recipe, so an update check compares it with the installed item.

This module only depends on voluptuous (through packs.py).
