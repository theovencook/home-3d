"""Room locating from Bluetooth signal strengths - pure logic, no Home Assistant imports (unit-testable).

How a room is chosen, every STEP seconds per tracked device:
1. Window: the mean RSSI per scanner over the last WINDOW seconds (a scanner that heard nothing is *missing*, not far).
2. Evidence: weighted kNN against the fingerprints learned on the calibration walk (rooms without fingerprints are
   reached through the nearest-scanner fallback: a scanner placed in a room speaks for it).
3. Filter: a forward filter over the rooms - staying is likely, moving through a door to a neighbour less so, other
   jumps rare (the door graph comes from the floor plan).
4. Hysteresis: the shown room only changes when another room leads with SWITCH_PROB for SWITCH_HOLD steps.
5. Presence sensors: a motion/presence sensor of a room turning on moves the device there at once, when Bluetooth
   finds that room plausible (a neighbour of the shown room, or some belief) - Bluetooth says who, the sensor when.
