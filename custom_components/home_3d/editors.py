"""Who may change the plan (#7).

A list of Home Assistant users kept in `.storage`. Until an admin picks the editors, every admin is one (and an admin
added later becomes one too); once picked, the list decides, so a non-admin can be an editor and an admin can be left
out (a wall tablet signed in as an admin, say). Only admins change the list (in the editor's settings), so it must keep
at least one admin: otherwise nobody could open the editor to change it back.
