"""Items that moved between packs (#110).

A placed pack item's type names its pack ("pack:<pack id>:<item id>"), so moving a bundled item into another pack
changes the id that every placed copy, recipe copy (#2), pin and rollback entry (#26) refers to. `moved_items.json`
next to this module lists every move as old type -> new type and ships with the integration; a test checks that
every entry leads to an item a bundled pack has.

Plans migrate wherever they come in: when a home loads (written back once, like the recipe copies), when a plan is
saved (an imported plan or home, a backup or a restore point being restored, the sample home). An old id still
resolves through the table, so a plan exported before a move loads and renders. A pack all of whose items moved away
can be retired: nothing needs it any more.

This module only depends on the standard library and recipes.py.
