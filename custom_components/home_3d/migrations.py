"""Plan migrations (#165): a plan's `version` counts its format, and each step here turns a plan of one version into
the next.

Every plan the backend takes in goes through `migrate_plan` before it is checked (BUILDING_SCHEMA runs it first): a
stored plan when a home loads, a save from an older client, an imported file, a backup, a restore point. So the plan
the editor, voice, time travel and the sensors see is always of the current version, and a later format change has
one place to go: a new step at the end of MIGRATIONS and PLAN_VERSION one up.

Rules for a step:
- it gets the plan as stored (not yet checked: fields may be missing or of the wrong kind) and returns a new plan,
  leaving its input as it was; a part it cannot read stays as it is, for the check to report
- it is idempotent: run on its own output it changes nothing
- it never drops data the newer format can hold; Home.async_load keeps the plan as stored as a restore point before
  it writes a migrated one back

The frontend keeps reading older plans (normalizeBuilding in model.ts) for exports and older backends; new
migrations go here only.
