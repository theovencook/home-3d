# The frontend files are served under /api/ (#218): Home Assistant's service worker takes /api/ paths from the network
# only, while it answers any other path, and Home Assistant's own page, from its cache first. The extra module, the
# panel's module_url and the card loader all name ONE URL, the start file (MAIN_BUNDLE), for every restart and every
# update, so a page the service worker kept from before an update names the same module as the panel. The start file
# (frontend boot.ts) holds no build: it asks build.json at a URL no cache has seen which build is served and imports
# that build's app (APP_BUNDLE?v=<build>, kept for a year). So a page that names an old entry, a proxy that turns
# no-cache into hours (#340) or a browser that kept the start file still run the current build after one load (#357).
# The start file and the loader are never kept (no-cache); a stale one does no harm.
