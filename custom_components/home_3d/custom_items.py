"""The household's own items (#13), made in the item editor.

They are plain pack v2 items (docs/packs.md), checked with the same schema as a pack's item files, kept in `.storage`
and shared by everyone who uses this Home Assistant. The library gets them as one more pack, `household.custom`, so
in a plan a custom item is the furniture type `pack:household.custom:<item id>`, on every install that has it. An
exported item is an item file; it imports on another install as it is. Custom items never go into a pack folder of
this repository.
