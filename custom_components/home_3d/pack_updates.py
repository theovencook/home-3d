"""Pack updates (#26): update checks, per-item updates, auto-update, pin and roll back.

A placed pack item is drawn from the plan's copy of its recipe (#2, recipes.py), so a newer release of its pack
changes nothing in the house by itself. A placed item "has an update" when the installed item differs from the copy
and is not an older release than it (an older release never silently replaces a newer one). Updating an item puts a
copy of the installed item into the plan; with the auto-update setting on, that happens without asking whenever a
newer release arrives (an import, an install, a scheduled check, a Home 3D update that brings a bundled pack).

Packs installed from GitHub (#25) are checked on the schedule the household sets (daily, weekly or monthly at a
time, or off): when the pack's own pack.json at the ref names a higher release, the check records "update available"
(#189); an editor sees what it changes (items added, changed, removed) and installs it, or, with auto-update on, the new
release is installed into the library by the check itself (placed items still keep their copies). A pack folder in a
repository with several packs is compared by its own release, so a release of the repository that changes other packs
is no update for it.

A pinned pack is left alone: no check installs a newer release of it, auto-update skips its items, and an import of
another release asks first. Rolling back puts back the release a pack had before its last update (and the placed
items that had taken that update), and pins the pack so the next check does not bring the update back.

The packs are shared by every home (#53), so are their updates (#164): an update, an auto-update and a roll back
change the placed items of every home, and the list of items with an update covers every home. Removing a pack forgets
its pin, its previous release and its last check.

The household's own items (#13, `household.custom`) are never listed: placed copies follow their edits by themselves.
Bundled packs come with Home 3D itself; their placed items follow the auto-update setting like any other.
