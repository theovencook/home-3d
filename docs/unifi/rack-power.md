# UniFi rack power and accessories checklist (#145)

Items in `theovencook.unifi/network/`, written by `python tools/unifi_rack_power.py` (a test fails while a file
differs; edit the catalogue in the script, not the JSON). Sizes are W x D x H in mm from techspecs.ui.com (fetched
30 Oct 2026). Full-width gear is drawn on the 482.6 mm panel with a 442.4 mm body. Height is the U height less 0.8 mm.
techspecs gives no axis labels, so the order follows the physical form factor. `watts` is our estimate of the unit's
own draw (the maker gives no idle figure for these), so every row is marked unverified for watts.
