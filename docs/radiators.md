# Radiators checklist (#140)

Radiators added to `theovencook.devices/heating` for ticket #140, so most UK and EU homes can be modelled. Each is built
from simple shapes by us; no maker pictures or 3D files are used. All ids start with `radiator_`, so Home 3D treats them as
heaters and colours them from cold blue to hot red from a linked temperature sensor (`shadeKind` in `room-effects.ts`).

Size is W x D x H in mm (the item's `size` x 1000, to 0.1). The height includes a 40 mm valve and pipe zone under panel and
column radiators; the nominal height in the next column is the maker's body height. Wall-mounted items sit 110 mm off the
floor (towel rails 200 mm) and flush to the wall (the back of the item is the wall side).

Status: `maker` = a manufacturer page gives the figure; `retailer` = only shops give it; `unverified` = our best estimate
from typical UK catalogue sizes, to be checked against the real product. Nominal heights and lengths are the standard UK
catalogue steps, but none was checked against a live maker table in this pass (so every row is `unverified`).

Watts: a heating radiator's output is heat, not electric draw, so hydronic items carry no `watts` field (it is an electric
figure for racks). Nominal outputs at delta T 50 (EN 442) belong in a maker table; none was verified, so none is recorded.
Only the dual-fuel towel rail has `electric: true` and `watts: 300` (its element, a typical size).

Already in the library, not duplicated: type 11 600 x 800 and 600 x 1200 (`radiator_single_*`), type 22 600 x 600, 1000, 1400
(`radiator_trv_*`), 3-column 600 x 600 and 600 x 1000 (`radiator_column_*`), flat tube 600 x 600 / 1000, low-level 300 x 1400 / 1800,
vertical 1800 x 340 / 500, towel rails 800 / 1200 (`towel_rail_*`), cast iron 6 / 10 sections, electric 1000 / 1500 W, and the
kitchen-bath towel rails. New type 11 and 22 sizes join the existing families.
