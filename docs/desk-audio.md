# Desk audio and streaming gear checklist (#147)

Desk and studio gear in `theovencook.office/tech/`: mixers, audio interfaces, control surfaces, microphones,
studio monitors and key lights. Sizes are W x D x H in mm. We model each device ourselves from simple shapes; no maker
pictures or 3D files are used. Tags carry the model names (GoXLR, Stream Deck and so on) so a Home Assistant device can
be matched by name. Powered items are `electric` with an estimated typical `watts` (USB bus power for the small ones).

Status: `maker` = a manufacturer page gives the figure; `retailer` = only shops give it; `unverified` = no source
found, the figure is our best estimate and should be checked against the real device. Sizes were looked up on 30 October
2026 through web search summaries, so retailer figures are worth a second look against the maker pages.

Existing items not duplicated: the `theovencook.living` bookshelf speakers, `ring_desk_lamp` (a table lamp with a ring),
the `monitor_*` screens and keyboards.
