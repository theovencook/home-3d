# 3D printer models checklist

Shared by the printer tickets #102 (Bambu Lab), #103 (Prusa), #104 (other FDM makers) and #105 (resin, wash and cure, workshop kit).
Each ticket updates only its own rows: set `status` to `done` and fill `size` and `source`. Add rows rather than editing other batches' rows.

All items live in `custom_components/home_3d/bundled_packs/theovencook.makers/tech/`. Every printer id contains `3d_printer`
(live progress ring, chamber light, camera tap); enclosed printers have a chamber light part (`glow`), open ones a nozzle or toolhead LED.
Items are modelled from simple shapes in this repo; no maker images or 3D files. Sizes are the maker's outer dimensions in mm (W x D x H, including spool holder where it is part of the frame).

Source for the Bambu rows: the maker's tech-spec pages (bambulab.com/en/<model>/tech-specs and store.bambulab.com), fetched with a browser user agent in ticket #133. The AMS add-on sizes below are the maker's "Product Size" / "Body Dimensions" figures.

Source for the #104 and #105 rows: checked in ticket #133 (30 Oct 2026). Maker spec pages mostly returned HTTP 429 or 403 to automated fetching, so most figures come from 3DJake / Micro Center / other retailer spec tables, reviews, or maker figures quoted in search results; each row says which, and how many sources agree. Rows marked unverified have no usable source; the reason is in the row. Multi-colour units (CFS, ACE Pro, CANVAS) sit on top and add their height as before; their own sizes found in #133 (CFS 379 x 314 x 276, ACE Pro 366 x 283 x 235, CANVAS 168 x 68 x 95) are not yet used for the variant offsets.

Bambu Lab enclosure: Bambu sells no separate enclosure; the H2/P2S/X-series are already enclosed and the A1 series stays open (an enclosure tent is part of #105).

Resin and wash and cure sizes (#105) were checked in #133; see each row.
