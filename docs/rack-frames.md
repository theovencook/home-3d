# Rack frames checklist (#116)

Every empty rack in the IT & network pack (`theovencook.it`, `network/rack_*.json`), with its external size
(W x D x H, mm), its U count and where the size comes from. The files are written by `node tools/rack-frames.ts` from
`frontend/src/rack-catalogue.ts`; edit the list there, not the JSON.

Status: **verified** = a maker page (lanberg.eu product pages open fine) or two or more retailer listings agree; **single** = one listing; **derived** = worked out from a sibling model (no listing found for
that exact size), check before relying on it; **generic** = a typical size, no specific product.
Retailer listings often disagree by 5-10 mm on height (castors, lids); the figure below is the one most listings give.
U space is 44.45 mm per U and sits inside the height with room for plinth or castors.

## Things to check by hand

- Every `derived`, `generic` and `unverified` row above (left: the 9U desktop frame, the 25U relay rack, the 6U generic mini rack, the AV rack).
- Wall racks hang with their centre 0.9-1.3 m above the floor (`wall_y`); adjust in the editor.
- Mount depths (`mount_depth`) are left to the item's depth minus the cabinet insets, not taken from the makers' "usable depth".
